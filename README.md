# WorldExplorer Desktop - the ultimate Catalyst competitor.

I've always been wondering, why hasn't jdev082 just released the Python edition of Catalyst already?? For that reason, I've decided to make WorldExplorer Desktop, a browser designed to beat the upcoming next-gen Catalyst before it even starts.

Features include:

Cookie blocking - Since WorldExplorer Desktop inherits code from the Browser, it can block cookies before they even start.
Free(dom) - With WorldExplorer Desktop, there is no license, meaning you can do anything with it. In fact, if you'd like, you can even make profit off of it! You can also relicense it easily.

No Electron junk required - Since WorldExplorer Desktop runs off of Python, there is no need to use the bloated thing called Electron.
