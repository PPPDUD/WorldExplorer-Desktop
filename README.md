# WorldExplorer Desktop - the ultimate Catalyst competitor.

I've always been wondering, why hasn't jdev082 just released the Python edition of Catalyst already?? For that reason, I've decided to make WorldExplorer Desktop, a browser designed to beat the upcoming next-gen Catalyst before it even starts.

Features include:

Cookie blocking - Since it inherits code from the Browser, it can block cookies before they even start.
Free(dom) - With WorldExplorer Desktop, there is no license, meaning you can do anything with it. In fact, if you'd like, you can mke profit off of it
